In order to avoid future confusions about deadlines for your weekly homework, remember that **all homework assignments are due before lecture on Wednesday of the relevant week**. If for some reason the deadline is extended, you will receive an explicit notification either via email or via an update to this site. 

If due to some glitch on Moodle you notice that the stated deadline is anything different from the corresponding Wednesday before lecture, *please disregard that*. Again, unless I or one of your TAs **explicitly announce** otherwise, assume that all assignments have the usual deadline. 

My apologies for any past confusions.
