This is the website for PHIL 160 at [UMass Amherst](http://www.umass.edu). Announcements, readings, and other relevant information will be posted here. If you are enrolled in this class, you should be checking [this website](http://perezcarballo.org/phil160) regularly, as well as the [course calendar](http://perezcarballo.org/phil160/calendar).

For your convenience, I have set up a mailing list for this course. I encourage you to subscribe in order to be notified of announcements on this site. Note, however, that you will only be notified of updates to the site once a day. (If there are no new updates on a given day, you will receive no emails.)

<!-- more -->

I have also set up a [Moodle page](https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=13334) for this website. However, we will only use that page for two purposes: you will submit your assignments there, and you will be able to review your grades for the course. If I ever need you to check the [Moodle page](https://moodle.umass.edu/course/view.php?id=13334) I will make sure to make an announcement [on this page](http://perezcarballo.org/phil160). 

(Of course, your TA may well want to use Moodle for announcements to students in his or her discussion sections. Please check with your TA about this.)

If you are enrolled in this class, or are thinking about enrolling, you may want to take a look at the [course syllabus](http://perezcarballo.org/phil160/syllabus).
